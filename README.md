Decode encrypted math expression

This program decodes all valid variations of an encrypted mathematical expression. It supports four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The program takes four arguments as input:

	•	operand1: The first operand (an integer).
	•	operand2: The second operand (an integer).
	•	operation: The mathematical operation to perform (e.g., +, -, *, /).
	•	result: The result of the operation (an integer).

Key Features:

	•	Operands and the result may include hidden digits, represented by a specific character, and the program decodes all valid combinations.
	•	Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
	•	The program ensures no leading zeros are present in the decoded numbers.

Usage:

The program is designed to help decode and validate expressions where some digits are hidden, ensuring that all valid possibilities are explored. This can be useful in various coding challenges and cryptographic problems.
